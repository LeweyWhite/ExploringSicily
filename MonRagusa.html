            <h1 class="Ragusa"> THE MONUMENTS OF RAGUSA </h1>

        <p> Ragusa is not simply to be looked at: it is to be crossed, listened to, and breathed in.It is a city born twice: first as a medieval settlement, then as a Baroque marvel, rebuilt with grace and determination after the earthquake of 1693. Since then, Ragusa has remained suspended between two souls: Ibla, the ancient and enchanted part, and Superiore, the newer city that proudly overlooks the landscape of the Hyblean hills. Within this duality lies its magic, and its monuments are the most authentic voice of that enchantment.
          At the heart of it all, in the center of Ragusa Ibla, stands the Cathedral of San Giorgio, a creation that is more than architecture: it is theater, a prayer carved in stone. Its tower-like façade, with the scenic staircase climbing toward the sky, is breathtaking. It was designed by the great Rosario Gagliardi, who succeeded in shaping faith and beauty in perfect harmony. Upon entering, one is embraced by a sense of peace and wonder, among sculpted altars and the neoclassical dome that dominates the surrounding landscape like a beacon of light.
          Climbing up to Ragusa Superiore, you are welcomed by the Cathedral of San Giovanni Battista, an emblem of Hyblean Baroque.<br> Its imposing and richly decorated façade tells the story of rebirth after destruction. Inside, the light filtering through the naves gently touches artworks, statues, and paintings that speak of a faith lived and passed down through generations. It’s a church that seems to embrace its faithful, a reminder that in Ragusa, hope has always been stronger than fear.
          But if you truly want to touch history, you must stop in front of the Portal of San Giorgio, which miraculously survived the collapse of the old church. It’s a proud and solitary Gothic portal that preserves the legend of Saint George slaying the dragon—an eternal symbol of the triumph of good over evil. Its medieval decorations, its time-worn reliefs, are echoes of a past that endures, refusing to fade away.
          Connecting the two souls of the city is the Ponte Vecchio, also known as the Capuchin Bridge. Built in the 19th century, it is more than just a link between two points—it is a bridge between eras, between different worlds of the same city. Walking across it, looking out over the valley of the San Leonardo River, is an experience with something poetic about it. As if Ragusa, from that bridge, wanted to whisper a story to you through the wind.
          Finally, in one of the city’s most evocative areas, stands the Church of San Francesco all'Immacolata. Founded in the 13th century and reshaped over the centuries, this church blends spirituality and art. Its three naves house Baroque altars, silences heavy with prayer, and works that tell the simple yet profound life of the Franciscans. It is a place that seems to hold, like a treasure chest, the most intimate soul of Ragusa.
