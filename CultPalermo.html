        <p>Palermo is not just a city, it is a feeling. A mix of history, faith, pride and memory
that lives above all in its traditions, as old as the stones that pave its streets. If you want to
truly understand Palermo, it is not enough to visit it: you have to experience it in the days when time stops and the
people gather around their roots.<br>
Among all the celebrations, there is one that is more than a party: it is a collective act of love. The Festino
of Santa Rosalia, every July 14, transforms Palermo into an open-air theater. It is the night in which the
city entrusts itself to its “Santuzza”, the one who, according to legend, saved Palermo from the plague in
1624. An enormous procession crosses the Cassaro, with a triumphal chariot decorated like
a work of baroque art that carries the statue of the saint among lights, music, choirs, songs and tears. The
sky explodes in fireworks and the entire city breathes a sense of rebirth. It’s not just religion,
it’s identity.<br>
But if the Festino is the heart of Palermo, November 2, the Feast of the Dead, is its soul. On this
day the deceased are not forgotten, but live again in the stories of grandparents, in the
smells of the kitchen and in the gifts left “secretly” to children. According to tradition, it is the
deceased loved ones who bring gifts and sweets: sugar puppets, marzipan fruit, “bones of the dead” biscuits. In
every home, the silence is filled with memories, and death stops being scary: it becomes another form of
presence.<br>
When Saint Joseph arrives, on March 19, the city fills with decorated tables and gestures of
solidarity. The bakers devoutly knead symbolic shapes, families prepare
votive altars, and the air is filled with the scent of sfince, puffy and soft sweets, filled with ricotta and
candied fruit. It is a tradition that has the flavor of simplicity, of hands dirty with flour and hearts full of faith.
And the night before, on March 18, the city lights up with the Vampe: bonfires lit in the popular neighborhoods, amid
joyful shouts and archaic rites that smell of fire and spring.<br>
But Palermo is also mystery, ancient legends and rites linked to the elements. The night of San Giovanni,
between June 23 and 24, is a return to nature. It is believed that the waters of the sea
have purifying powers, and so, at midnight, young and old dive into the sea in search of fortune,
health and love. On the beaches, small fires are lit, people dance and sing, as if time
were suspended between the sacred and the pagan.<br>
In this journey through bonfires, processions and baskets of sweets, the true face of Palermo is revealed: a city
that resists, that remembers, that celebrates life in all its forms. Its traditions are not just
folklore: they are the voice of those who lived, loved and defended it. Palermo is not visited: it is listened to,
eaten, dreamed. It is lived, with all the senses
