        <p> CATANIA CULINARY DISHES:Catania, with its strategic location at the foot of Mount Etna and overlooking the sea, boasts a cuisine that blends the flavors of the sea, the land, and a strong Arab influence, reflected in dishes rich in taste and tradition. Here are five typical dishes that represent Catanese gastronomy:Arancini (or Arancine). Although the origin of arancini is debated and shared by many Sicilian cities, Catania is particularly famous for its version. Arancini (also called *arancine* in some variants) are fried rice balls filled with meat ragù, peas, and cheese, but in Catania, variations with butter or with sausage and eggplant are also highly appreciated. Crunchy on the outside and soft inside, they are one of the most iconic and beloved dishes of Sicilian tradition.Pasta alla Norma. Pasta alla Norma is undoubtedly one of the most representative dishes of Catania and, more broadly, of Sicilian cuisine. This dish features a fresh tomato sauce with fried eggplant, grated salted ricotta cheese, and fresh basil. It is said that the name “Norma” was inspired by the opera of the same name by Vincenzo Bellini, a famous composer from Catania. It is a dish that captures the simple and fresh flavors of Sicilian cooking, perfect for any occasion.Sicilian Caponata. Caponata is a dish that slightly varies from region to region, but the Catanese version is especially flavorful. It is a side dish or standalone meal made from eggplants, tomatoes, onions, capers, green olives, and pine nuts, all seasoned with a sweet and sour sauce made of vinegar and sugar. It’s a flavorful dish that combines sweet and tangy notes, typical of Sicilian cuisine and reflective of Arab influences in its preparation.Pesce Spada alla Ghiotta (Swordfish "Ghiotta" Style). Swordfish alla ghiotta is one of the most typical dishes of Catanese cuisine, where fresh fish from the Ionian Sea is cooked in a simple yet flavorful way. The swordfish is prepared with tomatoes, black olives, capers, and onions, all enhanced with olive oil and a pinch of oregano. The dish highlights the natural flavor of the fish, complemented by the intense aromas of local ingredients.Granita and Brioche.Catanese granita is a fresh and refreshing summer dessert, perfect for beating the heat. In Catania, granita is made with fresh fruit such as lemon, almond, or mulberries, and is traditionally served with *brioche col tuppo*—a soft brioche roll used to soak up the granita. This pairing is one of the most loved snacks by locals, often enjoyed for breakfast or in the afternoon to cool down during hot summer days.</P>
