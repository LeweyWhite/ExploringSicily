        <p>Catania, one of the most vibrant and fascinating cities in Sicily, is a land of traditions that are
intertwined with history, folklore and faith. Every year, the city celebrates ancient rites that tell
stories of devotion, culture and deep ties with the territory. Here are five traditions that
characterize the city of Etna:
<br>1. The Feast of Sant'Agata
The Feast of Sant'Agata, the patron saint of Catania, is undoubtedly the most heartfelt and
important tradition of the city. It is celebrated every year from 3 to 5 February, and represents an event of great
religious devotion and folklore. The procession carrying the simulacrum of Sant'Agata, covered in
wax and devotional songs, passes through the streets of Catania. The festival is also characterized by the
"candelora", where the faithful carry lit votive candles as a sign of devotion. The streets come
alive with parades, fireworks, and the famous "acchianata", a long and steep climb towards
Mount Etna, where the saintly Agatha is celebrated with a great show of faith and tradition.
<br>2. The "Bronte Pistachio Festival"
Even though it does not take place in Catania, the Bronte Pistachio Festival, held in
the nearby town of Bronte, is an event that involves the entire city and its province. The Bronte pistachio, known as one of the best in the world, is the protagonist of numerous traditional
dishes and desserts, such as pistachio ice cream or "pasta with pistachio and ricotta". The festival celebrates the
pistachio harvest and the agricultural traditions linked to this prized fruit, and attracts numerous
visitors looking for a unique gastronomic experience.
<br>3. The "Festa della Patrona di Catania" (Sant'Agata alla Marina)
In addition to the main feast of Sant'Agata, the Feast of Sant'Agata alla Marina is another
tradition that involves the people of Catania. This celebration takes place in the
city's seaside district and recalls the devotion of the population towards the Saint. The procession at sea is
a suggestive event, with the boats that join in a collective dance around the simulacrum
of the Saint, while the waters of the sea become a reflection of the lights of the celebrations.
<br>4. The "Festa di Santa Lucia"
The Feast of Santa Lucia, celebrated on December 13, is another religious festival deeply felt in Catania.
Santa Lucia is the protector of sight, and her feast is celebrated with a procession that
crosses the streets of the city. During the celebration, the faithful carry the statue of
Santa Lucia in procession, accompanied by songs, prayers and a strong devotion. A typical dish that is
consumed on this occasion is "pasta with broccoli and sardines", a traditional
Catanese dish that is prepared in honor of Saint Lucia.
<br>5. The "Festa di San Nicola"
Another established tradition is that of the Festa di San Nicola, which takes place in December.
Although San Nicola is not the patron saint of Catania, his feast is particularly felt in the city,
especially in the neighborhoods of the historic center. Tradition has it that the faithful celebrate San Nicola
with a series of religious events, including a solemn mass and a procession that passes through the
main places of worship in the city. The feast is followed by banquets and popular celebrations that
honor the figure of San Nicola as a bearer of miracles.
