            <h1 class="Ragusa"> THE TRADITIONS OF RAGUSA </h1>

        <p>Ragusa is not just a city: it is a collective memory that is renewed every year among stone alleys,
popular songs and scents that smell of home.<br>
Here, traditions are not simple celebrations: they are heartbeats that tell who we are, where
we come from, and why certain emotions, certain words, certain gestures are never forgotten.
The greatest of all is the Feast of San Giorgio Martire, patron saint of Ragusa Ibla. It arrives at the end of
May or in the first days of June, but in reality it begins much earlier, in the hearts of the faithful. The
simulacrum of the saint descends from the Cathedral amidst torches and applause, while the city dresses in red and
gold. His "ballad", when the statue is carried on shoulders and made to dance amidst fires and applause,
is a moment in which faith and passion merge. "Tutti Truonu!" shout the devotees, and in that cry you can
feel all the pride of a people who never forget.<br>
But Ragusa has two souls, and the second shines on August 29 with the Feast of Saint John the Baptist,
patron saint of Ragusa Superiore. Here the tradition becomes more intimate, but no less intense. The streets
fill with barefoot faithful, dressed in red, who carry lit candles in a pilgrimage full of
meaning. And at the table, the festive dish is prepared: the "gnucchitti rausani", a
handmade pasta, seasoned with broth and stuffed chicken, which unites families around a meal that
smacks of identity.<br>
In the month of May, another sacred figure walks among the people: it is Maria Santissima Addolorata,
whose feast is celebrated on the third Sunday of the month. The "unveiling" of the statue, the day before, is one of those moments that move even the hardest hearts. Then, the procession passes through Ragusa
accompanied by songs, firecrackers and a fireworks display that explodes above the
baroque domes as if to say: “We are here, again, together.”
But not all traditions live in the light of day. Some are consumed in the silence of homes,
in the whispers of grandmothers. Like the ritual of “scioghi i viermi”, which was practiced on Christmas night.
A formula whispered three times, to free children from “spiritual” worms, symptoms of illness and
rest. Alongside this, the art of reading tarot cards was passed down in many families: not
for fun, but to seek answers, omens, comfort. It is the most magical and intimate part of the
Ragusan tradition, the one that unites the sacred with the mystery.<br>
And when summer comes to an end, Ragusa does not let it go in silence. With the Farewell to Summer
in Marina di Ragusa, the second Saturday of September, the city celebrates with music, fairs, exhibitions and
local flavors. It is a celebration of light and nostalgia, where the community comes together to toast what
has been and prepare for what is to come. It is not just about closing a season: it is a way
to say goodbye, with the sea as witness.
